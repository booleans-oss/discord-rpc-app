## Prerequisites ‼️
To be able to have a cool image, you will need to create your Discord Rich Presence Application. 
### 1. Create your App
Go on [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to create your application. 
The name of the application is important as it would be the name of the game you will be playing with the Rich Presence.
You will see ``Client ID`` which is the ID you will use in a moment.

### 2. Set up your Presence
You will then go in the tab **Rich Presence -> Art Assets**. It is there that you will upload the pictures you want to display. The pictures need to be at least 512x512. **Important:** Remember the name of the pictures as it is the only way to know which one to display. After that you are done with Discord Application.
